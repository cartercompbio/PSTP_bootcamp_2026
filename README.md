## Bioinformatics Resources

### Online resources:
[Biology Meets Programming: Bioinformatics for Beginners](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics)<br>
[Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/c/bioinfalgorithms/featured)<br>

### Recommended UCSD Courses:
**BIOM262 Quantitative Methods/Genetics** - Several notebooks were taken/adapted from this course and I recommend it if you want an introduction to bioinformatics methods.<br>
**CSE284 Personal Genomics/Bioinformatics** - This is an invaluable course (focusing on personal genomics) that blends theory and application seamlessly. Information from this course also made its way into bootcamp. <br>
**CSE258 Recommender Systems & Web Mining** - This course is focused on machine learning applications (primarily in Python), while also providing some introductory theory. This is a great course to get your feet wet in the ocean of ML.<br>
**BNFO286 Network Biology & Biomedicine**<br>
